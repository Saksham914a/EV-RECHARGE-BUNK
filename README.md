# EV-RECHARGE-BUNK

The EV Recharge Bunk Management System is a web-based platform designed to simplify and streamline the process of locating, booking, and managing electric vehicle charging stations. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with Firebase Firestore & Authentication, the project supports real-time booking, role-based dashboards, and Google Maps to display bunk locations.
There are two types of users:
Admins can add recharge bunks, and oversee user activity.
Users can view nearby EV bunks, search on a map, and book available slots for charging.

This system helps bridge the gap between EV owners and charging infrastructure, enhancing accessibility and planning.
